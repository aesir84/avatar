This work is about creating a kind of a wrapper for Oculus SDK functionality.

The initial purpose was to create a hierarchy of classes which can later be used to build customized
VR applications on top of them. The project contains a few such applications as a proof of concept.

One of the main goals of this effort was to use 'Qt5 only' approach and to verify, that it is actually applicable.

Currently the project is built for VS2013 and tested only on Windows OS. At the moment the project is focused on Oculus SDK version 0.5.0.1. The version of Qt currently used is 5.4.1.
